* Java Swing image representation
Images are represented as RGBA in CSS: rgba(R, G, B, A). In Java Swing, there
seems to be a hexadecimal encoding. Everything is encoded within an integer.

Integer: 32 bits.

RGBA, (0-255): 8 bits, 4 values: 32 bits.

Integer encoding of RGBA values: #AARRGGBB, expressed in base16/hex.
